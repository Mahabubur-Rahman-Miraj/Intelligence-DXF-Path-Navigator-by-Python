# Intelligence DXF Path Navigator by Python

## Overview
**Intelligence DXF Path Navigator by Python** is a Python-based tool designed to perform efficient path planning and navigation using DXF files. This project leverages the power of `ezdxf` for processing and manipulating DXF data and `matplotlib` for visualizing complex path layouts. It provides a robust solution for engineers and developers working with CAD designs and spatial path planning.

## Features
- Load and process DXF files.
- Visualize paths and geometries using `matplotlib`.
- Flexible and customizable path navigation system.
- Handles complex DXF file structures efficiently.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- `ezdxf` – for working with DXF files.
- `matplotlib` – for plotting and visualization.

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install ezdxf matplotlib
